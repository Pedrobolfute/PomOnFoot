# PomOnFoot

Pomodoro App thought and developed on graduation period.

The idea came in APS class (System Analysis and Design), and then I started to model it on Figma.

The meaning of PomOnFoot came from a series of mark from Pedrobolfute,
where we have Pedrobolfute > PedrOnFoot > DiariOnFoot > WeOnFoot > PomOnFoot.

Meaning some things:

- **OnFoot** : process of walk; that means to walk one step at a time without stop

- **...** : means that it didn't ended yet

I started to develop it on WEB 1 class (Programation for Web).
When the project development started I called two frinds mine to help.

This project was developed in pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
